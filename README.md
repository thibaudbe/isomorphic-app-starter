Isomorphic app starter
===

An isomorphic proof of concept with Expressjs and Gulp to prerender Reactjs.

I've set 2 variables to test Reactjs rendering. Simply enable or disable JavaScript in your browser : 
- In the server side, ```state``` will return "disable". This is the part which is concerned by SEO.
- In the client side, it'll return "enable".


## Init app

Install dependencies

	sudo npm install


## Start server

Server listen on port 3000 at ```http://localhost:3000/```.

	npm start
