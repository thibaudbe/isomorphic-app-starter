Isomorphic app starter
===

An isomorphic proof of concept with Expressjs and Gulp to prerender Reactjs.

I've set 2 variables to test Reactjs rendering. Simply enable or disable JavaScript in your browser : 
- In the server side, ```state``` will return "disable". It's the SEO concerned part.
- In the client side, it'll return "enable".


## Init app

Install dependencies

	sudo npm install

You need to run default ```gulp``` task to compile the first time bundle app in public folder.


## Start server

Server listen on port 3000 at ```http://localhost:3000/```.

	npm start
